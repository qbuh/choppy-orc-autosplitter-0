it appears that the autosplitter is not working. This is probably a result of me (qbuh) messing with the code a bit too much. I'll try to fix it soon in the mean time I'd recommend trying to reload the page or finding another means to play choppy orc. You can also contact me on discord (@quibuh) about this so that I can fix it
